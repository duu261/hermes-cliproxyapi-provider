# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- Manifest v2 metadata: `requires_hermes: ">=0.21.7"` (`hermes plugins install` refuses older
  Hermes; a manually copied plugin directory is not checked), license, homepage and tags.
- Test that `plugin.yaml`, `pyproject.toml` and the catalog User-Agent carry one version.
- README: when to use this plugin instead of a Hermes custom provider, and how
  `hermes doctor` checks each provider.
- SECURITY.md.

## 0.1.0

- One Hermes provider per CLIProxyAPI instance and provider group: `claude` on Anthropic
  Messages, `codex` on Responses, other groups on chat completions.
- Live model lists filtered per group, with context window, vision, reasoning levels and
  output limits from CLIProxyAPI's public model lists. Cached at 0600, no keys.
- Zero-config `cpa-local` provider.
- Plain HTTP only to loopback, private, shared CGNAT or ULA addresses; no redirects; capped
  responses; errors carry no URLs, bodies or keys.
